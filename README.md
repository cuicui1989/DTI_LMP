# Drug-Target-Interaction-based-on-Low-Rank-Matrix-Projection (LMP)
The codes for predicting interactions between drugs and targets based on low-rank matrix projection on heterogeneous biological data. 

The code is written by Ratha Pech. For comments, suggestions and questions, please contact me at ratha.pech(at)gmail.com 

Please cite the paper if you use this code: 
"A generalized method toward drug-target interaction prediction via low-rank matrix projection "

There are 5 benchmark datasets in this implementation:
1. Matador: contains only interaction information
2. Enzyme 
3. Ion Channel
4. GPCR
5. Nuclear receptors

The enzyme, ion channel, GPCR and nuclear receptors contain three types of information 
e.g.,interaction information, drug similarity and target similarity  

Using the above the datasets, please cite the original papers.
